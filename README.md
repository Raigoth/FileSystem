# FileSystem by Stephen Chassie
In this repository there are snippets of the a **File System** (using a Sdisk) and a **Record System** (using a Flat File and an Index File). There is also the .cpp and .h of the File System included. The *Table.h* and *Table.cpp* would be added to the File System in order to turn it into a Record System. The *Main.cpp* has some commented code out, because this part would be added for the Record System as well. It should be noted that the code in this repository was complete and working properly.** *However, I have removed segments of the code* and replaced those segments with comments on the purpose of the code and what it achieved. This code will not work if you just download and try to run it.**

## File System is in the Sdisk directory
This includes: disk1.txt, FileSystem.cpp and .h, Sdisk.cpp and .h, Shell.cpp and .h, and Main.cpp.
The disk1.txt is for the File System without the flat, index, and data files

If the Table.cpp and .h is uncommented and added into the File System along with the uncommented segment of code in Main.cpp then you would have the Record System with the flat, index, and data files.

## Record System is in the Record System directory
This includes: disk1.txt, data.txt
The text files in this directory are the data file and the disk1.txt after the Record System snippets have ran.
